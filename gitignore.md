# Git ignore

## Definition

The `.gitignore` file is a text file that tells Git which files or folders to ignore in a project. It is used to exclude files that are not relevant to the project, such as temporary files, build artifacts, or configuration files that should not be committed to the repository.

## Example

A typical `.gitignore` file might look like this:

```
# Ignore build artifacts
build/
dist/

# Ignore configuration files
*.config
*.properties

# Ignore temporary files
*.tmp
*.bak

# Ignore environment-specific files
.env
```
