# Git Pull

## Definition

`git pull` fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into the current branch of your local repository.

## Example

You have a local repository that is out of sync with the remote repository (e.g., new commits have been made by a team member). You use `git pull` to update your local branch with those changes. After the command, your local branch will match the remote branch.

## Code Snippet

```
# Pull changes from the remote repository's main branch
git pull origin main
```
